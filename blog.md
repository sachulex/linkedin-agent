**3 Hidden Profit Leaks in Ecommerce Analytics**

Ecommerce founders, itâ€™s time to dive into your data. Even the best analytics can hide profit leaks that eat into your margins. Here are three areas to watch closely:

1. **Shipping Costs**  
Many founders overlook shipping expenses in their profit calculations. Are you absorbing costs to compete? Make sure you accurately track both shipping fees and any discounts you offer. Small adjustments can lead to significant savings.

2. **Return Rates**  
Returns can be a major profit sink. Analyze your return data: Are certain products or categories returning more frequently? Understanding why can help you make informed decisions about inventory and product descriptions, reducing unnecessary returns.

3. **Abandoned Carts**  
Cart abandonment is common, but are you tracking the reasons? Analyze your checkout process for friction points. A complicated checkout or unexpected fees can deter customers. Simplifying this experience can recover lost sales and improve your margins.

Keep a close eye on these hidden leaks in your analytics. Addressing them can lead to clearer profit margins and a healthier bottom line.
