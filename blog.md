### 3 Hidden Profit Leaks in Ecommerce Analytics

As an ecommerce founder, you’re likely drowning in data. But not all data is created equal. Here are three hidden profit leaks that could be draining your bottom line.

#### 1. Misinterpreted Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

Many founders overlook the details in their COGS calculations. If you’re not including all related expenses—like packaging, shipping, and storage—you might be underestimating your costs. This leads to inflated profit margins that don’t reflect reality.

#### 2. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Overlook

Are you tracking the full spectrum of expenses tied to acquiring a customer? It’s not just marketing spend. Consider sales team salaries, software tools, and any discounts offered. If you’re not analyzing CAC effectively, you might be spending more to acquire customers than you realize.

#### 3. Ignoring Cart Abandonment Rates

High cart abandonment rates are a red flag. If you’re not diving into the reasons behind it—like shipping costs, website performance, or user experience—you could be missing out on major sales. Analyzing this data can help you identify and fix the leaks.

### Conclusion

Keep a close eye on these hidden profit leaks. By refining your analytics, you’ll gain better insights into your financial health and make informed decisions to enhance your ecommerce profitability.
